# Ionic Weather
## ðŸŒ¥ An open-source weather app, built with the Ionic framework ðŸŒ§

### Instructions for installing
It's a bit of a setup, thankfully not too complicated, but *it is* long â€” so bear with me. 
##### npm
 - Clone this repo
 - `npm install` 
##### firebase
- Navigate to the functions folder (`cd functions`)
 - `npm install` again
 - Make an account on firebase.google.com (it's free) and create a new project. Then make an account for Google's Cloud Platform. Have an API key ready. Do the same with OpenWeatherMap
 - Back at the console, type `firebase login`; it'll open up the browser for you to log in.
 - Pick your project from the console using the arrow keys
 - Run `firebase functions:config:set gmaps.key="YOUR_API_KEY"`
 - Replace `gmaps.key` with `owmapi.key` and run that function again
 - Run `firebase deploy`. It'll deploy the functions in the `index.ts` file and upload them to your firebase project. 
 - In your firebase account, copy the functions names and replace the ones in the Redux slices. They should have similar URL endings. 

### That's it. You're all set. Just have your commits begin with the issue-number. Thank you! ðŸ¤—
