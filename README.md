	ðŸŒ¥ Ionic Weather ðŸŒ§
</h1>

> **Ionic Weather** is built with React, Typescript, and Tailwind. It's a minimal weather application, unweighted by bloat or ads.
> Search is powered by Google. Weather is provided by OpenWeatherMap. The project uses Firebase Functions as a makeshift backend.
> **Ionic Weather** supports hourly and daily views, unit preferences, and geolocation.

The `README` for the backend [can be found](/functions/README.md) in the `functions` folder.
